# EPTDAC
The algorithm Edge-Preserved Thermal-Detail Adaptive Calibration (EPTDAC) is designed to merge infrared (IR) and television (TV) images taking into account the local parameters of each of them. An important point is calibration of images and adaptive weighted merging to preserve details from the TV range and warm information from the IR.
